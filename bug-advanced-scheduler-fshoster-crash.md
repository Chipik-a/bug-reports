**Status:** Verified ✅  
**Type:** Regression / Stability  
**Severity:** High  
**Environment:**  
- OS: Windows 11  
- App Version: [25.2.406]  
- Component: FSHoster  
- Scenario: Advanced Scheduler

---

## 🎯 Goal

Verify that the **Advanced Scheduler** no longer causes **FSHoster** to crash after modifying `last execution time`.

---

## 🐾 Steps to Reproduce / Verify Fix:

1. Install the application (ensure the build includes the advanced scheduler fix).
2. Locate and manually edit the **`last execution time`** parameter (in config or registry).
3. Restart the **FSHoster** service (or the application that includes it).
4. Open **Task Manager**.
5. Check the number of **FSHoster** processes.

---

## ✅ Expected Result:

- FSHoster starts normally.
- Number of FSHoster processes is as expected (e.g., 1 or 2 based on config).
- No crash occurs upon startup.

## ❌ Previous Behavior (Before Fix):

- FSHoster crashed on startup
